# QuranicJar (Native Version) ðŸ•Œâœ¨

QuranicJar is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that predicts a user's emotion based on their input and provides a relevant Quranic verse for guidance and comfort. The app now uses a locally integrated Core ML `.mlmodel` for emotion classification, eliminating the need for a backend API.

## Features

![image2](./showcase/4.png)

- **Emotion Prediction**: Users can input their feelings, and the app predicts their emotion using a Core ML model.
- **Supported Emotions**: As for now, there are 4 supported emotions which are **anger**, **fear**, **joy**, and **sadness**.
- **Quranic Verse Recommendation**: Based on the predicted emotion, the app provides a relevant Quranic verse for guidance.
- **Bookmark Verse**: Bookmark and filter your saved verses based on emotions.
- **Search Verse**: Search verses according to emotion types, Surah's name, or translation keywords.
- **On-Device Processing**: All emotion predictions are performed locally on the device using Core ML for improved privacy and performance.
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a progress view while the emotion prediction is being processed.

### File Descriptions

1. **`QuranJarApp.swift`**:
   - The main entry point of the iOS app.

2. **`ContentView.swift`**:
   - The main screen where users can input their feelings, predict emotions, and view Quranic verses.
   - Uses the Core ML model for emotion prediction.

3. **`WelcomeView.swift`**:
   - The initial screen where users are greeted and asked to enter their name.

4. **`EmotionClassifier.mlmodel`**:
   - A Core ML model fine-tuned for emotion classification.
   - Maps predicted emotions to Quranic verses using an embedded dataset.

5. **`quran_emotions.json`**:
   - A JSON file containing Quranic verses mapped to specific emotions.

## How It Works

1. The input text is processed by the Core ML model (`EmotionClassifier.mlmodel`) embedded in the app.
2. The predicted emotion is mapped to a relevant Quranic verse using the `quran_emotions.json` dataset.
3. The app displays the predicted emotion and the corresponding Quranic verse to the user.
